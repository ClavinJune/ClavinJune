### Hi there, I'm Clavin June ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer who likes to explore things. Right now, I'm focusing on infrastructure because I'm working as a DevOps now.
While I like working on the server side, I do quite a bit of client side projects.
Not limited to software engineering, I like to explore other things like history, geography, mythological and philosophical stuff.
I love to express my thoughts on my [blog](https://clavinjune.dev) as an author and [podcast](https://positif.dev) as a co-host.
